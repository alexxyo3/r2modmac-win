⚠️ IMPORTANT: READ IF APP DOES NOT OPEN ⚠️

This application is unsigned because it was compiled using GitHub Actions.

If you see "App is damaged and can't be opened" or similar errors,
it's because macOS prevents unsigned applications from running by default.

TO FIX THIS:

1. Drag the "r2modmac.app" into the Applications folder.
2. Open the "Terminal" app (Cmd+Space, type "Terminal").
3. Copy and paste the following command and press Enter:

   sudo find /Applications/r2modmac.app -exec xattr -c {} \;

4. Enter your system password if prompted and press Enter.
5. You can now open the app normally!

(You will need to repeat this process every time you update the app.)
